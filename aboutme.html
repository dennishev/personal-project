    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <h3>My name is Dennis Patrushev & I am passionate about all things technology. I’m 23 years old & I grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. When I was 19 years old I decided to pack my bags & hop on a plane & fly into the unknown. The last four years i’ve been living in a small town called Redding, California. The beauty of Northern California made me fall in love with wilderness, the mystical Northern California Coast, & the beautiful mountains. I was set on pursuing photography & videography as my career choice, but things changed in the beginning of the year in 2018. I had a desire to go back to school & within a month, I was accepted into Bethel School of Technology. I never coded a day in my life, but I was eager to learn something I always felt unqualified for. I’m currently wrapping up my season in school & extremely excited to find a career in the Tech World. I live life with hope & a constant expectation of being called into greatness. I’m not career driven but instead purpose driven. I’m coding with a purpose... </h3>
